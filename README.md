## Chapter 1 - Back to Basics

Starting off by talking about the fundamental structure of the program in this programming language. 

We will start off about the headers which contain the information that is required for the program.
We only need to include the things that we need to use in the program. This can be added to as you program, so this you can come back to later.

There are pre-existing header files, or you can create your own header files, either way you have to import is using #include.

Below shows a code example of including the input output stream header file.
```C++
#include <iostream>
```

Having namespace allows you to tell the compiler to use std, which we will see below in this chapter why it is useful.
This part also shows that ; is used to show the end of a statement.
```C++
using namespace std;
```

Like a quite a few other programming languages, such as Java, program starts at main().
This has 'int' in the signature of the method as this is later returned as an exit code.
```C++
int main() {
    return 0;
}
```

"cout" is a commonly used function for outputting to the terminal. 
Without the name space we would hae to put STD and two colons prior to writing "cout".
"endl"  marks the end of the line, so anything after this will be printed on the line after this.
```C++
cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
```

By combining all the things in this chapter so far we can make our first program of C++ which prints out "Hello World!" to the terminal.
```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Chapter 2 - Running a Program

Now that we have a program in our file, we can save this file with the extension of ".cpp", any extra header files would have the extension of ".h".
With this you will need knowledge of the terminal or command line in order to run this file, as C++ runs on this (future tutorial potentially to be added).

Navigate in the command line to the current directory and use the format
>g++ *FILE NAME*.cpp

Replacing the file name with what you named your file, then in order to see a result you type
>./a.out

This will run the executable file that was generated from the first command... and voil√†, you have your program running if of course without errors.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
You may have a lot of questions about what this repo is about, and I will try and answer as many as I can.

### Where is that great "Hello World!" program again?
Here you go!
```C++
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {

    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
### What is this repo about?
This repo is a basic and fundamentals tutorial to the foundations of C++.

This is done through practically using code and comments to demonstrate the features and syntax of the language.

### What is C++?

> C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes".
